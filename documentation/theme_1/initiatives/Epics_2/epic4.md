# Epic 4 - Define a process for code reviews and collaboration

**Description:** The epic aims to define a process for code reviews and collaboration to ensure that code changes are reviewed and approved by the appropriate parties before they are merged into the codebase. The process will also promote collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members.

**Goals:**

- Define a process for code reviews that is efficient and effective.
- Establish clear guidelines and criteria for code reviews.
- Promote collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members.
- Ensure that code changes are reviewed and approved by the appropriate parties before they are merged into the codebase.
- Improve the overall quality of the codebase by identifying and addressing issues early in the development process.

**User Stories:**

- As a developer, I want to have clear guidelines for code reviews, so I can ensure that my code changes meet the necessary quality standards.
- As a reviewer, I want to have clear criteria for code reviews, so I can provide meaningful feedback to the developers and ensure that the code changes meet the necessary quality standards.
- As a team member, I want to be able to collaborate with others easily and share knowledge, so we can improve the overall quality of the codebase.

**Dependencies:**

- Availability of resources to develop and implement the code review and collaboration process.
- Integration with existing development and testing tools and processes.
- Support from the project team.

**Risks:**

- Lack of buy-in from the team or stakeholders may result in limited adoption of the code review and collaboration process.
- The process may add additional overhead and delay release timelines.
- The quality of the codebase may be impacted if code changes are not reviewed and approved by the appropriate parties before they are merged.

**Estimated Value:** The implementation of a code review and collaboration process can significantly improve the quality of the codebase and promote knowledge sharing among team members. The estimated value of this epic is high.

**Priority:** The priority of this epic is high, as it is crucial to the success of the project and will impact the team's ability to ensure that code changes meet the necessary quality standards and promote collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members.
