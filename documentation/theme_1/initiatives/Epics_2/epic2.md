# Epic 2 - Implement automated testing for every theme, initiative, epic, user story, and task

**Description:** The epic aims to implement automated testing for every theme, initiative, epic, user story, and task to ensure that the software is of high quality and meets the user requirements.

**Goals:**

- Implement automated testing for every theme, initiative, epic, user story, and task to ensure that the software is of high quality.
- Reduce manual effort and increase efficiency.
- Increase the speed of delivery and time-to-market.
- Improve the user experience by ensuring that the software meets the user requirements.

**User Stories:**

- As a developer, I want to implement automated testing for my code changes, so I can identify defects faster and improve the quality of software releases.
- As a tester, I want to have access to automated testing frameworks, so I can identify defects faster and improve the quality of software releases.
- As a project manager, I want to reduce manual effort and increase efficiency, so the team can deliver software releases faster and with higher quality.

**Dependencies:**

- Availability of resources to develop and implement automated testing frameworks.
- Integration with existing development tools and processes.
- Support from the project team.

**Risks:**

- The automation process may introduce new defects and errors.
- Integration issues may cause delays.
- Lack of buy-in from the team or stakeholders may result in limited adoption of the automated testing process.

**Estimated Value:** The implementation of automated testing for every theme, initiative, epic, user story, and task can significantly improve the quality of software releases and reduce manual effort. The estimated value of this epic is high.

**Priority:** The priority of this epic is high, as it is crucial to the success of the project and will impact the team's ability to deliver software releases faster and with higher quality.
