# Epic 3 - Establish a bug tracking and resolution process

**Description:** The epic aims to establish a bug tracking and resolution process to ensure that software defects are identified, tracked, and resolved in a timely and efficient manner.

**Goals:**

- Establish a process to track and manage software defects.
- Improve communication between the development and testing teams.
- Ensure that software defects are resolved in a timely and efficient manner.
- Improve the overall quality of the software by reducing the number of defects.

**User Stories:**

- As a developer, I want to have a process to track software defects, so I can prioritize and address them in a timely manner.
- As a tester, I want to be able to report software defects easily and have visibility into their status, so I can ensure they are resolved before the release.
- As a project manager, I want to have visibility into the number of defects, their severity, and their resolution status, so I can make informed decisions about release readiness.

**Dependencies:**

- Availability of resources to develop and implement the bug tracking and resolution process.
- Integration with existing development and testing tools and processes.
- Support from the project team.

**Risks:**

- Lack of buy-in from the team or stakeholders may result in limited adoption of the bug tracking and resolution process.
- The process may add additional overhead and delay release timelines.
- The quality of the software may be impacted if defects are not identified and resolved in a timely manner.

**Estimated Value:** The establishment of a bug tracking and resolution process can significantly improve the quality of software releases and reduce the number of defects. The estimated value of this epic is high.

**Priority:** The priority of this epic is high, as it is crucial to the success of the project and will impact the team's ability to identify and resolve defects in a timely and efficient manner.
