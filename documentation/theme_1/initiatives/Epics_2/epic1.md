# Epic 1 - Develop a continuous integration and deployment process

**Description:** The epic aims to develop a continuous integration and deployment process to improve the overall efficiency of the project by automating the software build, testing, and deployment process.

**Goals:**

- Develop a continuous integration and deployment process to automate the software build, testing, and deployment process.
- Reduce manual effort and increase efficiency.
- Increase the speed of delivery and time-to-market.
- Improve the quality of software releases.

**User Stories:**

- As a developer, I want to automate the software build and testing process, so I can focus on developing new features.
- As a tester, I want to automate the testing process, so I can identify defects faster and improve the quality of software releases.
- As a project manager, I want to reduce manual effort and increase efficiency, so the team can deliver software releases faster and with higher quality.

**Dependencies:**

- Availability of resources to develop and implement the continuous integration and deployment process.
- Integration with existing development tools and processes.
- Support from the project team.

**Risks:**

- The automation process may introduce new defects and errors.
- Integration issues may cause delays.
- Lack of buy-in from the team or stakeholders may result in limited adoption of the continuous integration and deployment process.

**Estimated Value:** The development of a continuous integration and deployment process can significantly improve the efficiency of the software build, testing, and deployment process. The estimated value of this epic is high.

**Priority:** The priority of this epic is high, as it is crucial to the success of the project and will impact the team's ability to deliver software releases faster and with higher quality.
