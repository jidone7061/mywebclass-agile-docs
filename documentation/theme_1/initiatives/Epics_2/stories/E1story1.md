### User Story 1
As a developer, I want to automate the software build and testing process, so I can focus on developing new features.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- The build and testing process should be automated using a continuous integration tool like Jenkins or Travis CI.
- The build process should compile the code and generate executable binaries.
- The test process should run all unit tests and report the results.
- The automated build and testing process should be triggered on every code commit to the repository.
- The automated build and testing process should notify the development team of any build or test failures.
