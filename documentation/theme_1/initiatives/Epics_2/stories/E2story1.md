### Story 1

As a developer, I want to implement automated testing for my code changes, so I can identify defects faster and improve the quality of software releases.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Automated tests are implemented for all code changes.
- All automated tests pass before code changes are committed.
- Automated tests are integrated into the continuous integration and deployment process.
