### User Story 2

As a tester, I want to be able to report software defects easily and have visibility into their status, so I can ensure they are resolved before the release.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A defect reporting process is implemented and communicated to testers.
- Testers have access to the defect tracking system to report defects.
- The defect tracking system provides visibility into the status of each defect, including whether it has been resolved or is still open.
- The defect tracking system sends notifications to testers when the status of a defect changes.
- Testers are able to add comments and attachments to defects to provide additional information.
