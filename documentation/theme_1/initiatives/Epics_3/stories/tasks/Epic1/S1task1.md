### Task Title: Set up website monitoring and email notification system
#### User Story: As a website owner, I want to be alerted immediately if the website goes down or experiences performance issues

Configure the monitoring system to send an email notification to the designated email address when the website is down or has a significant decrease in performance. Include information about the cause and severity of the issue in the email notification.

#### Acceptance Criteria:

- The website monitoring system should check the website status and performance at least once every 5 minutes.
- The monitoring system should be configured to send an email notification to the designated email address when the website is down or has a significant decrease in performance.
- The email notification should include information about the cause and severity of the issue.

- Effort Estimate: 4 hours

#### Assigned To: TBD
